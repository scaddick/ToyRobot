# ToyRobot
A simulation of a toy robot constrained to a table 

Unit Testing with XUnit

Built in Visual Studio 2019 should run out the box

appSettings.json will allow for altering the table size 

if I had more time to work on this I would like to have included the ability to read in commands from a text file,
add a second robot to control independently, checks between robots whether the location they are moving to is valid and currently accessible.

there is limited commenting withing the code, I aim to have the functions as readable without the need for comments as much as possible.
